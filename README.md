#### Hi,

I’m Minh-Nguyet Xayavong, and people usually call me Minh.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English Studies, minoring in Anthropology, from Goethe University - Frankfurt am Main. Since 2021, I have moved to the US to be with my family.

Documentation, writing, translation, and content creation are my passions, I'm developing this GitHub profile as part of my portfolio. Are you looking for someone to:
- Assist the technical writer lead in the documentation process?
- Document your product or software for users to understand and optimize user experience?
- Take over writing tasks that are overloading your team?
- Write training, internal, external materials or any documents that require concise and easy-to-understand language?
