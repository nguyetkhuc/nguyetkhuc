#### Hi,

I’m Minh-Nguyet Khuc, and people usually call me Minh.
I'm currently a student at Goethe University - Frankfurt am Main and an aspiring Technical Writer. 
Documentation, writing, content creation are my passions, I'm developing this GitHub profile and [my website](https://my-writing-portfolio.com/) as parts of my portfolio. Are you looking for someone to:
- Assist the technical writer lead in the documentation process?
- Document your product or software for users to understand and optimize user experience?
- Take over writing tasks that are overloading your team?
- Write training, internal, external materials or any documents that require concise and easy-to-comprehend language?
